    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I was born in Salt Lake City, Utah. I have two brothers and a Vizsla named Enzo. If you're unfamiliar with the breed Vizsla, they are adorable. You can find more information on them <a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/vizsla/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <h3>Interests</h3>
    <p>In junior high and high school, I was an avid volleyball player. 
      As of now, I have played for about ten years. During that time, I have been the captain of four different teams. 
      I played a year of club at Mt. O, a year at Club GSL, and two years under Austin Linford at Club V North. 
      Since my junior year of high school, I have been coaching the sport that I love so much. 
      I spent two seasons as a Fall League coach at Club GSL for 10u and 12u teams 
      before becoming a Head Coach for Club V South's 3rd 15u Club team.</p>

    <h3>Research Interests</h3>
    <p>As a researcher, I'm primarily interested in applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in various fields,
       such as cybersecurity, athletics, and economics. I also enjoy researching gamification and gamified learning. At the CSRL, 
       I primarily study gamified learning and its effect on uthe emotional experience during ndergraduate education. At the AFRL,
       I was on a team researching visual object detection and visual object tracking, subfields within computer vision to be
       applied to autonomous drones.</p>

    <h3>Ambitions</h3>
    <p>Ultimately, I would like to become an AI engineer at a company in the NASDAQ
       that enables companies to make better management decisions through the use of machine learning. 
       As a secondary job, more in my own free time, I would like to become the Head Coach of a D1
      women's volleyball team.</p>
