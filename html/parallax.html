      <h2>#199</h2>
      <p>
        At 7th on the depth chart, no one expected Brady to see the field on gameday at Michigan. 
        Brady worked relentlessly wanting to become the starter during his last two years. He earned that job his Junior year.
        His senior year, he was forced to split time as a starter with a young challenger. Nearly bringing his team to an impossible comeback,
        his coach named him the sole starter for the remainder of the season, where he had many 4th quarter game-winning drives,
        earning himself the title of "The Comeback Kid." Picked 199th in the 2000 NFL draft, with every NFL team having passed up the opportunity
        to draft him at least 5 times, he wasn't expected to have a notable career in the pros. Oh how the analysts were wrong.

      <h2>The Dynasty</h2>
      <p>
        Brady is dubbed the "winningest" quarterback in NFL history. He holds just about every record related to winning, 
        including most regular season wins, most postseason wins (more than double second place), most total wins, 
        highest winning percentage, only quarterback to win all 16 regular season games (2007), and one of four quarterbacks to beat all 32 teams.
        If you split Brady's career in half and pretended that two separate quarterbacks produced the stats that Brady produced
        during that time, both quarterbacks would have better numbers on every line of the QB stat sheet than the average Hall of Fame quarterback.
        Brady essentially has two Hall of Fame careers, and he's not even done playing yet. It's impossible to say there's 
        ever been a player better than him.

      <h2>TOMpa Bay</h2>
      <p>
        Despite his 20 incredible years with the Patriots, haters still doubted Tom Brady's status as the greatest of all time. 
        Those doubters were silenced after Brady's seventh Super Bowl ring, 
        which he won his very first year after moving to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
        Brady's instant success at his new team solidifies his reputation as the GOAT. 
        He now has 7 Super Bowl wins, 10 Super Bowl Appearances, 14 Pro Bowl selections, 
        18 division titles during his 19 years as a starter, 3 league MVP awards, 5 Super Bowl MVP awards, and 14 conference championship games 
        (including eight consecutive from 2011 to 2018) to go along with his sponsorships 
        from Aston Martin, Subway, and Under Armor. On top of all this, 
        Brady boasts his own wellness/lifestyle brand TB12, and just recently announced a new fasion line called Brady Brand.
